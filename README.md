# battstat

`battstat` is a shell script that displays formatted information about the status of your battery. 

Information is displayed in the order the format tokens are written. For example, the screenshots below show my __tmux__ status line running the command `battstat --percent-when-charged {i} {t} {p}`. This will display an icon, the time remaining when charging and discharging, and finally the percentage but only when the battery is fully charged. Format tokens can be written in any order and as many times as you like.

## Examples

There are a few ways to customize the output of `battstat`. Charging and discharging icons can be replaced with single character or multi-character strings. The `-c` flag sets the charging string and the `-d` flag sets the discharging string.

```
$ battstat -d "üçï" {t} {i}
 10:30  üçï

$ battstat {t} {i}
 11:47  üîã

$ battstat -c "AC:" -d "BAT:" {i} {p} {t}
 BAT:  82%  12:11

$ battstat {i} {p}    
 üîã  81%

$ battstat -d "Battery:" {i} {p}
 Battery:  81%
```

## macOS menu bar

Using [bitbar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) you can add the output of `battstat` to the menu bar on macOS. There are many ways to customize the output so I suggest reading over the [writing plugins](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#writing-plugins) section to understand what's possible.

The screenshot above is using the following shell script. Make sure the script is executable and placed in the bitbar plugins path.

```
#!/bin/sh

time=$(/usr/local/bin/battstat {t})

echo "($time) | size=13"
```

## Supported Operating Systems

* __macOS__: Details are collected via `pmset(1)`.
* __Linux__: Details are collected via `upower(1)`.
* __OpenBSD__: Details are collected via `apm(8)`.

## Notes

The script does not account for laptops with multiple batteries. Newer ThinkPad models include both a swappable and non-swappable battery which may cause problems when searching for the battery with `upower`. I currently don't have the means necessary to test against these models but pull requests are of course welcomed.

## Install

1. Grab the script. Here are a few options:

    * Download and extract the [zip](https://github.com/imwally/battstat/archive/master.zip).
    * `$ git clone https://github.com/imwally/battstat`
    * `$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imwally/battstat/master/battstat`

2. Move it to your favorite binary path and make it executable.

```
$ mv battstat /usr/local/bin
$ chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/battstat
```
